#### Description

- Add in assets/3dmodels any additional stl file that you want to use
- In the assets/rendered_2d_images folder end up the random still images of the 3d models 
- The assets/background_images/detect folder has backgrounds that the model does not ever see. I create synthetic images with them and feed them to the model during detection. 
- In the assets/synthetic_data/images/detect folder I have the synthetic images create using the backgrounds in the assets/background_images/detect folder. These images I feed to the model during detection.
- I have left my created files to be easier to start experimenting
